# Metrics

gojira ships a small set of pure functions under `lib/metrics/` that you can call against issue lines.

## cycle_time

```
cycle_time.compute(working_times, first_column_to_count) => days
```

Sums the durations spent between the first counted column and the final column. Use it to look at how long an item spent actively in flight.

## throughput

```
throughput.compute(lines) => count
```

Returns the number of items that reached the resolved set during the configured date range.

## velocity

```
velocity.compute(lines) => points
```

Returns the sum of story points across the lines. Items without a `points` field count as zero.

## wip

```
wip.compute(lines) => count
```

Returns the number of items whose status is neither `Backlog` nor `Done`.

## percentile

```
percentile.compute(values, p) => number
```

Returns the percentile of a numeric array using linear interpolation. `p` is a fraction in `[0, 1]`. Edge cases: empty/null input → `0`; `p<=0` → min; `p>=1` → max.

## aggregate

```
aggregate.summarize(values) => { count, min, max, mean, median, p85, p95 }
```

Wraps the common descriptive statistics in one call. Empty/null input returns the same shape filled with zeros.

## Summary helper

`csv_writer.summary(lines)` bundles `throughput`, `velocity`, `wip` and `cycle_time_stats` (the `aggregate.summarize` of every `lead_time` on the lines) into one object — handy when wiring metrics to a dashboard.

When the config flag `include_metrics` is `true`, the JSON writer wraps its output as `{ summary, lines }` instead of a bare array, so a single Jira-extract gives you both the raw records and the aggregated picture.

## Charts (HTML writer)

When `include_metrics` is true and the writer is `html`, the report appends a `<section class="charts">` panel with five inline SVG charts (zero JavaScript at view time):

| Chart | Data | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| Cumulative flow (approximate) | resolved_at + times_array | Stacked bands per column over time — items in each status as the work flows |
| Cycle time distribution | lead_time | Histogram of lead times across resolved issues |
| Cycle time over time | resolved_at + lead_time | Scatter plot — outliers and drift in cycle time |
| Throughput per ISO week | resolved_at | Bar chart of items resolved per ISO week |
| Time in each column | times_array | Per-issue stacked bar — where each item spent its time |

## Real transitions via the changelog

By default the CFD back-derives entry timestamps from `resolved_at` minus the durations in `times_array`, which assumes forward-only flow. Set `include_changelog: true` in `project_config.json` and gojira fans out a `?expand=changelog` request per issue, then uses the real `status` transition timestamps Jira recorded. When real events are present the CFD title drops the "approximate" suffix.

Costs: one extra HTTP request per issue. For large boards this can dominate run time — leave `include_changelog` off when you only need cycle-time/throughput numbers.

## Aging WIP

Set `include_aging_wip: true` in `project_config.json` and gojira issues a second JQL search (`status!=Done`) to fetch items currently in flight. The aging WIP chart shows one horizontal bar per active item, sorted longest-aging first, coloured by status. When `include_changelog` is also on, the "days in current status" comes from the actual transition into that status; without it, the chart falls back to days since `created`.

In the HTML report the charts panel renders in a responsive 2-column grid — one row of cards for every two charts on a wide screen, single-column on phones.
